## Project status

The repository is being prepared for a staged, production-oriented implementation. The current Flutter application is an early prototype; a successful build alone does not mean the product is ready for real members or real coin balances.

- Flutter client: `lib/`
- Firebase configuration: `firebase.json`, `.firebaserc`, `lib/firebase_options.dart`
- Trusted backend: `functions/` (Firebase Cloud Functions, TypeScript)
- Flutter/Firebase validation: `.github/workflows/validate.yml`
- Hosting deployment workflow: `.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml`

## Development principles

1. Keep `main` stable; implement and validate changes on feature branches and review them through pull requests.
2. Never trust client-supplied owner flags, coin balances, commission rates, room permissions, or reward eligibility.
3. Perform financial mutations in trusted server transactions and write immutable, linked ledger entries.
4. Keep secrets, service-account keys, private keys, and production credentials out of Git.
5. Do not enable real-money purchases, real member balances, or production deployment until Firebase project configuration, authorization rules, emulator tests, operational monitoring, and recovery procedures are verified.

## Backend validation

```sh
cd functions
npm install
npm test
```

## Firebase project note

`.firebaserc` currently selects `mawda-app-2026`, while the checked-in FlutterFire options file contains placeholder-looking values and a different project ID. Verify the actual Firebase app registrations and regenerate FlutterFire configuration from the intended project before production use. Do not infer project identity from the alias alone.

## Product specification

The approved Mawda product constitution is maintained through the project decisions and implementation plan. Major areas include identity and profiles, authentication, messaging and rooms, stores, coin wallet and transfers, attendance and advertising rewards, moderation, owner administration, privacy, trust and safety, and platform security.


## Authentication and access-control foundation

The current implementation includes Firebase email/password registration and sign-in, email verification, password-reset email, and an auth-state gate. A verified Firebase identity is not yet a completed Mawda member profile; profile completion and server-created member records are a separate implementation stage.

Firestore client rules are deny-by-default except for a member reading their own profile and their own wallet ledger, and reading a transfer in which they are a participant. All client writes to balances, ledgers, transfers, settings, audit logs, and profile documents are denied. Trusted Cloud Functions use the Admin SDK for approved server-side writes.

Storage rules currently deny all client reads and writes until authenticated upload/download endpoints, MIME validation, ownership checks, and retention jobs are implemented. This is intentional security staging, not a claim that media features are ready.

## Firebase configuration blocker

The checked-in `lib/firebase_options.dart` still contains placeholder-looking Firebase app identifiers and API key values, and its project ID differs from `.firebaserc`. Do not deploy or test real sign-in against production until the correct Firebase app configuration is regenerated for the confirmed project and validated. No credentials or service-account keys belong in Git.
